# Minecraft Agent!
by Yeidy Levels

-----

### General Overview
(include here description of unit, what class(es) it fits into, when...)
In Minecraft Education Edition, the agent is a mob that helps players learn coding by getting players to code the actions on it. The agent can be programmed to execute several tasks, like planting and harvesting, mining, chopping trees, and building. This unit will be intended for the fifth grade in the STEAM classroom.

### Motivation for Unit
(why have you decided to make this?)
This year, I am leading the Minecraft Student Ambassador program in my school. Students will train teachers and support their fellow classmates when using Minecraft in the classroom. I am interested in having these students explore the use of the agent in their builds, and writing code (block-based/Java/Python) while doing so.

- 4-6.CT.5
Identify and name a task within a problem that gets performed multiple times while solving that problem, but with slightly different concrete details each time.
- 4-6.CT.8
Develop algorithms or programs that use repetition and conditionals for creative expression or to solve a problem.
- 4-6.CT.9
Explain each step of an algorithm or program that includes repetition and conditionals for the purposes of debugging.
- 4-6.CT.10
Describe the steps taken and choices made to design and develop a solution using an iterative design process.
